# Lyrics Segmentation using Convolutions

This repository contains all the code needed to run and reproduce results reported in our COLING2018 paper.

## Abstract

Lyrics contain repeated patterns that are correlated with the repetitions
 found in the music they accompany. Repetitions in song texts
 have been shown to enable lyrics segmentation
 â€“ a fundamental prerequisite of automatically detecting the building blocks (e.g. chorus, verse) of a song text.
 In this article we improve on the state-of-the-art in lyrics segmentation by applying a convolutional neural 
 network to the task, and experiment with novel features as a step towards deeper macrostructure detection of lyrics.
